/// # Boot Mode
///
/// The system boot mode indicates the "mode" in which the system is booting. The boot mode concept allows the firmware
/// to accommodate system initialization specific to a given set of circumstances represented by the boot mode. It is
/// a single value set in the HOB producer phase (e.g. PEI) and passed to the DXE phase via the Phase Handoff
/// Information Table (PHIT) HOB. During the HOB producer phase, various modules may modify the boot mode until it
/// settles upon a final value before being passed to the DXE phase.
