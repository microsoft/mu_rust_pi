/// Sends/receives a message for a registered handler.
///
/// This protocol provides runtime services for communicating between DXE drivers and a registered MMI handler.
///
/// Usage is similar to EFI_MM_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.Communicate() except for the notes below:
///
/// - Communication buffer transfer to MM core should start with self::EfiMmCommunicateHeader.
/// - With the updated header, the header_guid field is redefine as header GUID for MM core to differentiate the
///   header format.
/// - The message_guid field is moved to be after the header_guid field to allow for decent alignment and message
///   disambiguation.
/// - The message_data field is replaced with a flexible array to allow users not having to consume extra data
///   during communicate.
/// - Instead of passing just the physical address via the comm_buffer parameter, the caller must pass both the
///   physical and the virtual addresses of the communication buffer.
/// - If no virtual remapping has taken place, the physical address will be equal to the virtual address, and so the
///   caller is required to pass the same value for both parameters.
///
///  @param this                       The protocol instance.
///  @param comm_buffer_physical       Physical address of the buffer to convey into MMRAM, of which content must
///                                    start with self::EfiMmCommunicateHeader.
///  @param comm_buffer_virtual        Virtual address of the buffer to convey into MMRAM, of which content must
///                                    start with self::EfiMmCommunicateHeader.
///
///  @retval Status::SUCCESS           The message was successfully posted.
///  @retval Status::INVALID_PARAMETER comm_buffer_physical was null or comm_buffer_virtual was null.
///  @retval Status::BAD_BUFFER_SIZE   The buffer is too large for the MM implementation.
///                                    If this error is returned, the message_length field
///                                    in the comm_buffer header, is updated to reflect the maximum payload
///                                    size the implementation can accommodate.
///  @retval Status::ACCESS_DENIED     The communicate buffer parameters are in an address range that cannot be
///                                    accessed by the MM environment.
