/// Sends/receives a message for a registered handler.
///
/// This protocol provides runtime services for communicating between DXE drivers and a registered MMI handler.
///
/// Usage is identical to EFI_MM_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.Communicate() except for the notes below:
///
/// - Instead of passing just the physical address via the comm_buffer parameter, the caller must pass both the physical
///   and the virtual addresses of the communication buffer.
///
/// - If no virtual remapping has taken place, the physical address will be equal to the virtual address, and so the
///   caller is required to pass the same value for both parameters.
///
///  @param this                       The protocol instance.
///  @param comm_buffer_physical       Physical address of the buffer to convey into MMRAM.
///  @param comm_buffer_virtual        Virtual address of the buffer to convey into MMRAM.
///  @param comm_size                  The size of the data buffer being passed in. On exit, the size of data
///                                    being returned. Zero if the handler does not wish to reply with any data.
///                                    This parameter is optional and may be NULL.
///
///  @retval Status::SUCCESS           The message was successfully posted.
///  @retval Status::INVALID_PARAMETER The comm_buffer parameters do not refer to the same location in memory.
///  @retval Status::BAD_BUFFER_SIZE   The buffer is too large for the MM implementation.
///                                    If this error is returned, the message_length field
///                                    in the comm_buffer header or the integer pointed by
///                                    comm_size, are updated to reflect the maximum payload
///                                    size the implementation can accommodate.
///  @retval Status::ACCESS_DENIED     The communicate buffer parameters or comm_size parameter,
///                                    if not omitted, are in an address range that cannot be
///                                    accessed by the MM environment.
